								<h2>What is AISA?</h2>
								<p>AISA is a non-profit organisation dedicated to reducing catastrophic AI risks by enhancing AI safety and governance in Asia. It serves as a platform for intergenerational AI policy dialogue, connecting junior researchers and seasoned civil servants from Global South countries in Asia with senior AI safety researchers from the Global North to produce practical and region-specific AI safety policy research.</p>

						<section id="why" class="box special">
							<header class="major">
								<h2>Why Do We Need AISA?</h2>
								<p>Southeast Asia lags behind in AI preparedness, creating an "algorithmic divide" that leaves the region vulnerable to AI's adverse impacts and missing out on its benefits. Despite significant investments from the U.S. and China in Southeast Asian AI startups, local capacity and governance remain weak. AISA addresses this gap by developing local talent and creating region-specific AI governance frameworks, thereby reducing catastrophic AI risks and empowering the Global South.</p>
